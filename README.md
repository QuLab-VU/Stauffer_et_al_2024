### Simple summary

The treatment of BRAF-mutant melanoma with BRAF inhibitors is severely limited in clinical practice, in part due to the emergence of drug tolerance via non-genetic adaptation to therapies. Improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie drug tolerance may lead to improved treatment strategies. Here, we describe a novel calcium-dependent signaling mechanism induced by BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) treatment that provides compensatory mitogenic signaling to drug-tolerant persister cells in the form of MAPK reactivation. This calcium signaling mechanism has not previously been recognized in BRAFi-tolerant melanoma, may initiate a novel line of scientific inquiry, and presents a host of novel targets for therapeutic development in this field.

### Summary of code
Code is primarily written in R Markdown (**.Rmd**) using [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) and rendered into HTML so output can be directly visualized using a browser. The HTML files cannot be directly visualized within GitHub and must be downloaded either individually as source files or as part of the entire repository and opened on your local computer.
